Kubernetes has become omnipresent. Whether you're part of a development team looking to deploy highly available apps or part of a data science team looking to run machine learning workloads in a scalable way - Kubernetes is often the platform of choice. The ecosystem around Kubernetes has grown considerably, and last year I used a project called Kubeflow a lot. Kubeflow is a ML platform on top of Kubernetes offering features such as distributed training or workflow orchestration. It makes life much easier if you just want to process your data and train your models in Python without worrying about the low-level stuff. However, having amazing tools like Kubeflow doesn't eliminate the need for an engineering mindset and a basic curiosity about what happens under the hood of the system. A DevOps knowledge bottleneck within a data science team can be fatal - once something is broken in the cluster, a team full of data scientists will be blocked and at a loss.

## Taking a Glance Under the Hood

One of things I noticed when checking out Kubeflow were Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and their respective controllers. For example, when you create a recurring Kubeflow Pipeline job, you actually create a custom resource of type `ScheduledWorkflow` in API group/version `kubeflow.org/v1beta1` (you can see this easily with `kubectl get scheduledworkflow.v1beta1.kubeflow.org`). All changes made to this resource are observed by a controller, which is basically a control loop running on Kubernetes that reacts to these changes.

The combination of a CRD with a controller is often called an operator. An example that is often used to explain operators is the native Kubernetes resource type `ReplicaSet` from the API group/version `apps/v1`. When you define a ReplicaSet in a yaml file like this
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: myreplicaset
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mycontainer
        image: myimage:v1
  # ...
```
you actually say that you want 3 pods (replicas) running the specified container. The controller for ReplicaSets is [shipped with Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager/) and watches for changes of ReplicaSets and Pods. The moment you create a Replicaset resource with `kubectl apply -f <yaml file>`, the controller spawns 3 pods. If you kill one of the pods, the controller will spawn another one. Basically, it will always check if the current situation in the cluster matches your definition (this is why Kubernetes is known to be declarative instead of imperative) and do whatever is necessary to reach the target state.

Now that we know the purpose of a controller, let's talk about how we can create a CRD and controller, just like Kubeflow and other frameworks do to extend Kubernetes.

## Creating an Operator
If you're familiar with golang, there are three ways to create an operator: `client-go`, `controller-runtime` and `kubebuilder`. Every one of these libraries/frameworks adds an additional layer of abstraction and relies on the library before. With `client-go` you start from scratch, `controller-runtime` will take care of some things for you and `kubebuilder` will automate as much as possible. 

Does this mean that you always go with `kubebuilder`, since it automates so much? o answer this, it is helpful to understand how the development process differs using the three options.

## Baseline client-go
Since both kubebuilder and controller-runtime use client-go under the hood, it makes sense to use development with pure client-go as our baseline. The following overview that I provide is by no means comprehensive, but it should give you a pretty concrete idea of the steps needed. There are two sources that explain the entire process very well, one being the [sample-controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller/blob/master/docs/controller-client-go.md) and the other one being this [code generation walkthrough](https://www.openshift.com/blog/kubernetes-deep-dive-code-generation-customresources). 

So, you want your controller to somehow observe changes to resources of a specific type on the k8s apiserver and retrieve the resource objects for processing. It is not a good solution for your controller to ping the k8s apiserver directly, as that would put too much load on it. Instead, client-go offers a caching mechanism. 

A so-called informer receives notifications from the k8s apiserver whenever an update happens. It retrieves the object in question and hands it over to an indexer that will store and index the object inside an internal cache. The informer will also invoke registered event handlers and pass the object to them. The event handlers are used to push the object key into a workqueue. Your custom controller then pops the key from there and reads the object from the cache for further processing. 

Event handlers and workqueues are part of your custom controller implementation. When you write the processing (reconciling) logic, you can talk to the k8s apiserver directly (e.g. you create a new pod) or you access the cache for read queries. For the former, you need to generate a clientset and for the latter a lister. In addition to that, you also need to generate the informer itself, so it can watch, cache and pass the resource object.

Now that we have a high-level overview, let's walk through the sample-controller files.

### Define your CRD
Remember the [Replicaset definition from the beginning](#taking-a-glance-under-the-hood)? Its first two fields `apiVersion` and `kind` specify the group/version and kind (=resource type). They are followed by a `metadata` section with fields such as `name`, `labels`, etc. These fields are shared by all k8s resource types. Finally, there is a `spec` section with fields specific to ReplicaSets only. 

When we define our CRD in golang, we follow the same structure:

* TypeMeta - Group/Version and Kind fields `apiVersion` and `kind`
* ObjectMeta - Standard k8s `metadata` fields like `name`, `namespace`
* Spec - Your custom fields
* Status - Optional status subresource with custom fields

From the sample controller's type definitions we can already guess that the resource type `Foo` is a wrapper around the k8s native resource type `Deployment`. 

```golang
/* source code from https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller/blob/master/pkg/apis/samplecontroller/v1alpha1/types.go */
package v1alpha1

import (
  metav1 "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1"
)

// +genclient
// +k8s:deepcopy-gen:interfaces=k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime.Object

type Foo struct {
  metav1.TypeMeta   `json:",inline"`
  metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`

  Spec   FooSpec   `json:"spec"`
  Status FooStatus `json:"status"`
}

type FooSpec struct {
  DeploymentName string `json:"deploymentName"`
  Replicas       *int32 `json:"replicas"`
}

type FooStatus struct {
  AvailableReplicas int32 `json:"availableReplicas"`
}

// +k8s:deepcopy-gen:interfaces=k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime.Object

// FooList is a list of Foo resources
type FooList struct {
  metav1.TypeMeta `json:",inline"`
  metav1.ListMeta `json:"metadata"`

  Items []Foo `json:"items"`
}
```
But what about those strange-looking comments `// +...` above the type definitions? These comments are actually tags and serve a purpose!

To use client-go, your golang types need to satisfy the `runtime.Object` interface. The interface comprises several deepcopy functions, and you can generate them with a tool called `deepcopy-gen`. To tell the tool for which types it should generate deepcopy functions, you can include global (package-wide) and local (specified per type) tags in your source code. 

Global tags are included in a file called `doc.go`: 
```golang
/* source code from https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller/blob/master/pkg/apis/samplecontroller/v1alpha1/doc.go */

// +k8s:deepcopy-gen=package
// +groupName=samplecontroller.k8s.io

// Package v1alpha1 is the v1alpha1 version of the API.
package v1alpha1
```
Here, the `// +k8s:deepcopy-gen=package` tag tells `deepcopy-gen` to create deepcopy functions for all types in the package `v1alpha1`. 

Local tags are placed before individual types. The tag `// +k8s:deepcopy-gen:interfaces=k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime.Object` placed above `type Foo struct {...}`  will tell `deepcopy-gen` to generate an additional deepcopy function for `Foo`.

Running `deepcopy-gen` on your package directory will generate a file `zz_generated.deepcopy.go` with the functions. You can see below that `DeepCopyObject` is not present for all types - that is due to the local tag we used.
```golang
/* snipped source code from https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller/blob/master/pkg/apis/samplecontroller/v1alpha1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go */
package v1alpha1

import (
  runtime "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime"
)

func (in *Foo) DeepCopyInto(out *Foo) { /* ... */ }
func (in *Foo) DeepCopy() *Foo  { /* ... */ }
func (in *Foo) DeepCopyObject() runtime.Object { /* ... */ }

func (in *FooList) DeepCopyInto(out *FooList)  { /* ... */ }
func (in *FooList) DeepCopy() *FooList  { /* ... */ }
func (in *FooList) DeepCopyObject() runtime.Object  { /* ... */ }

func (in *FooSpec) DeepCopyInto(out *FooSpec)  { /* ... */ }
func (in *FooSpec) DeepCopy() *FooSpec  { /* ... */ }

func (in *FooStatus) DeepCopyInto(out *FooStatus)  { /* ... */ }
func (in *FooStatus) DeepCopy() *FooStatus  { /* ... */ }
```
You probably also noticed in the files above that there are other tags unrelated to deepcopy, like `// +groupName=samplecontroller.k8s.io` or `// +genclient`. These are used by `client-gen` to generate the clientset for your resource type. [You can find the generated folder contents here](https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller/tree/master/pkg/generated/clientset/versioned) 

In addition to `deepcopy-gen` and `client-gen`, you also need to run `informer-gen` and `lister-gen` to generate informer and lister for your resource type. In the sample-controller project, these code generation steps were automated in [the script `hack/update-codegen.sh`](https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller/blob/master/hack/update-codegen.sh) so you don't need to manually run every generator in the command line. All code generators are part of the [code-generator](https://github.com/kubernetes/code-generator) project.

Lastly, you need to register your golang types: 
* [pkg/apis/samplecontroller/v1alpha1/register.go](https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller/blob/master/pkg/apis/samplecontroller/v1alpha1/register.go)
* [pkg/apis/samplecontroller/register.go](https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller/blob/master/pkg/apis/samplecontroller/register.go)

By doing so, we link the golang type `Foo` to the Kubernetes ḱind `Foo` in group/version `samplecontroller.k8s.io/v1alpha`. You can read more about it [here](https://book.kubebuilder.io/cronjob-tutorial/gvks.html#err-but-whats-that-scheme-thing).

### Define your controller logic 
If we look at [`controller.go`](https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller/blob/master/controller.go), we see that it interacts with 2 resource types: the native k8s Deployment and the custom Foo. Therefore, clientset, informer and lister for both resource types are required by the controller.
```golang
/* simplified source code from https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller/blob/master/controller.go */

import (
  "k8s.io/client-go/tools/cache"
  "k8s.io/client-go/util/workqueue"
  "k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes"
  appslisters "k8s.io/client-go/listers/apps/v1"
  appsinformers "k8s.io/client-go/informers/apps/v1"

  samplescheme "k8s.io/sample-controller/pkg/generated/clientset/versioned/scheme"
  clientset "k8s.io/sample-controller/pkg/generated/clientset/versioned"
  informers "k8s.io/sample-controller/pkg/generated/informers/externalversions/samplecontroller/v1alpha1"
  listers "k8s.io/sample-controller/pkg/generated/listers/samplecontroller/v1alpha1"
)

func NewController(
  kubeclientset kubernetes.Interface,
  sampleclientset clientset.Interface,
  deploymentInformer appsinformers.DeploymentInformer,
  fooInformer informers.FooInformer) *Controller {

  controller := &Controller{
    kubeclientset:     kubeclientset,
    sampleclientset:   sampleclientset,
    deploymentsLister: deploymentInformer.Lister(),
    deploymentsSynced: deploymentInformer.Informer().HasSynced,
    foosLister:        fooInformer.Lister(),
    foosSynced:        fooInformer.Informer().HasSynced,
    workqueue:         workqueue.NewNamedRateLimitingQueue(workqueue.DefaultControllerRateLimiter(), "Foos"),
    //...
  }

  //...
  
  fooInformer.Informer().AddEventHandler(cache.ResourceEventHandlerFuncs{
    AddFunc: controller.enqueueFoo,
    UpdateFunc: func(old, new interface{}) {
        controller.enqueueFoo(new)
    },
  })

  deploymentInformer.Informer().AddEventHandler(cache.ResourceEventHandlerFuncs{
    AddFunc: controller.handleObject,
    UpdateFunc: func(old, new interface{}) {
        newDepl := new.(*appsv1.Deployment)
        oldDepl := old.(*appsv1.Deployment)
        if newDepl.ResourceVersion == oldDepl.ResourceVersion {
            return
        }
        controller.handleObject(new)
    },
    DeleteFunc: controller.handleObject,
  })
  return controller
}
```
In the last couple of lines, you can see that the event handler `handleObject` (which pushes objects to the `workqueue`) is registered for the informer to invoke using `AddEventHandler()`. 

The control loop launches several concurrent workers, each of which fetches an item from the workqueue and calls `processNextWorkItem`.
```golang
/* simplified source code from https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller/blob/master/controller.go */

func (c *Controller) Run(threadiness int, stopCh <-chan struct{}) error {
  // Wait for the caches to be synced
  if ok := cache.WaitForCacheSync(stopCh, c.deploymentsSynced, c.foosSynced); !ok {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to wait for caches to sync")
  }
  // Launch workers to process Foo resources
  for i := 0; i < threadiness; i++ {
    go wait.Until(c.runWorker, time.Second, stopCh)
  }
  <-stopCh
  return nil
}

func (c *Controller) runWorker() {
  for c.processNextWorkItem() {}
}

func (c *Controller) processNextWorkItem() bool {
  // retrieve object key from workqueue
  // call reconciler logic in syncHandler 
  // if an error occured, requeue object key in workqueue
  // if everything was ok, forget from workqueue
}

func (c *Controller) syncHandler(key string) error {
  // get foo resource using foosLister (cache read access)
  // get deployment with the name specified in foo.spec using deploymentsLister
  // create deployment if it doesn't exist using kubeclientset
  // make number of replicas on deployment match number specified by Foo using kubeclientset
}
```
With the basic logic in place, we're ready to start up the controller in [`main.go`](https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller/blob/master/main.go):
```golang
/* simplified source code from https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller/blob/master/main.go */
package main

import (
  kubeinformers "k8s.io/client-go/informers"
  "k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes"
  "k8s.io/client-go/tools/clientcmd"
  "k8s.io/klog/v2"

  clientset "k8s.io/sample-controller/pkg/generated/clientset/versioned"
  informers "k8s.io/sample-controller/pkg/generated/informers/externalversions"
  "k8s.io/sample-controller/pkg/signals"
)

func main() {
  // snipped: initialize & parse flags

  // set up signals so we handle the first shutdown signal gracefully
  stopCh := signals.SetupSignalHandler()

  // create clients
  // masterURL, kubeconfig parsed from flags
  cfg, err := clientcmd.BuildConfigFromFlags(masterURL, kubeconfig)
  kubeClient, err := kubernetes.NewForConfig(cfg)
  exampleClient, err := clientset.NewForConfig(cfg)

  // create informers
  kubeInformerFactory := kubeinformers.NewSharedInformerFactory(kubeClient, time.Second*30)
  exampleInformerFactory := informers.NewSharedInformerFactory(exampleClient, time.Second*30)

  // create controller
  controller := NewController(kubeClient, exampleClient,
    kubeInformerFactory.Apps().V1().Deployments(),
    exampleInformerFactory.Samplecontroller().V1alpha1().Foos())

  // run informers
  kubeInformerFactory.Start(stopCh)
  exampleInformerFactory.Start(stopCh)

  // run controller
  if err = controller.Run(2, stopCh); err != nil {
    klog.Fatalf("Error running controller: %s", err.Error())
  }
}
```
Note that these are just the steps from a code-writing point of view. For the controller to run on the cluster, you need to build go binaries from your source code, build docker images, define deployment yaml files, configure certificates, RBAC permissions, and so on. These steps however are not specific to controllers and need to be done for any project you deploy.
## Comparing to controller-runtime
Using pure client-go, you need to
* define CRD types in golang
* generate deepcopy functions
* generate clientset, informer, lister
* create informer, lister, clientset for your controller to use
* write control loop
* write reconciler logic
* create and run your controller
* take care of deployment-related steps
  
You can skip some of the above steps by using controller-runtime. The above list is reduced to
* define CRD types in golang
* generate deepcopy functions
* write reconciler logic
* create and run your controller
* take care of deployment-related steps

In addition, controller-runtime offers easy ways to include admission and conversion webhooks and possibly other things which I haven't explored yet.

Since you no longer need to generate and create clientsets, informers and listers anymore, you might ask yourself if controller-runtime is still using any of these under the hood. The answer is yes, and if you're interested in the details, checkout my next post [Diving Into Controller-Runtime]({% link _posts/2021-03-12-diving-into-controller-runtime.md %}).

## Comparing to kubebuilder
Kubebuilder is not a library per se like client-go or controller-runtime - it is more like a framework that will generate an entire project for you. The project comes with generated files (including deepcopy functions) and you only need to fill in your type definitions and reconciler logic. It has its own tags `// +kubebuilder...`, which you can leverage to e.g. configure RBAC permissions or webhooks. These tags will make kubebuilder generate the necessary (`kustomize`-able) `yaml` files for your deployment, and depending on which features you configured, you only need to make minor edits to them. Last but not least, kubebuilder also includes a Makefile that automates project deployment. Thus, the list of steps you need to carry out yourself is even further reduced to
* define CRD types in golang
* write reconciler logic
* create and run your controller
  
## Summary
After exploring the three options, I personally would choose kubebuilder for any smaller, self-contained, green-field operator development. It speeds up development, but I also think that the automatic code generation can be a bit daunting, especially if you are trying to troubleshoot why something does not work as expected. The more is automated, the less you are aware of what is automated for you. 

If I had to add a controller to an existing legacy project (think of a giant server running multiple controllers), kubebuilder might not be my first choice. In that case, I would use controller-runtime and make my code integrate with the existing code structure. I also think that controller-runtime gives you the best out of two worlds: 1) it will save you development time like kubebuilder does 2) it will help you learn about the underlying concepts which will come in handy when you troubleshoot, similar to how development with pure client-go does.
