Ever since I heard of [Word2Vec][1] last year, I have been fascinated by the field of artificial intelligence. I knew I was a little late to the party, but then again I thought it was never *too* late to learn something new. Currently, I am taking online courses and reading up on papers to catch up with the latest research. To document my learning process, I decided to collect my notes in a blog with `Jekyll` and `Github Pages`. My main reason for choosing this combination was the simplicity and the support for `MathJax`. I am running Jekyll on `Bash on Ubuntu on Windows`.
